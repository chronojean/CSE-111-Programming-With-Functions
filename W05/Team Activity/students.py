import csv
# Core Requirements
# Your program must do the following:

# Open the students.csv file for reading, skip the first line of text in the file because it contains only headings, and read the other lines of the file into a dictionary. The program must store each student I-Number as a key and each I-Number name pair or each name as a value in the dictionary.
# Get an I-Number from the user, use the I-Number to find the corresponding student name in the dictionary, and print the name.
# If a user enters an I-Number that doesnâ€™t exist in the dictionary, your program must print the message, "No such student" (without the quotes).
