    <p>In other words, the storage efficiency of a can is the space
      inside the can divided by the amount of steel required to make the
      can. The formulas for the volume and surface area of a cylinder
      are:</p>    
    <div class="block formula"><var>volume</var> = π&thinsp;<var>radius</var><sup>2</sup>&thinsp;<var>height</var></div>
    <div class="block formula"><var>surface_area</var> = 2π&thinsp;<var>radius</var>&thinsp;(<var>radius</var> + <var>height</var>)</div>    
    <ul>
      <li>
        <div>π is the constant PI, the ratio of the circumference
          of a circle divided by its diameter (use
          <code>math.pi</code>)
        </div>

      <li>
        <div><var>radius</var> is the radius of the cylinder</div>

    <p>If you separate your program into functions, this problem will be      much easier to solve than if you don’t separate it into functions.      You are free to write any functions that you choose in your program,      but we <em>strongly</em> suggest that your program include at least      these three functions:</p>        <ul>      <li>        <div><code>main</code></div>      </li>      <li>        <div><code>compute_volume</code></div>      </li>      <li>        <div><code>compute_surface_area</code></div>      </li>    </ul>        <h4 id="required">Core Requirements</h4>    <ol>      <li>        <div>Your program must compute the volume of all 12 can          sizes.</div>      </li>      <li>        <div>Your program must compute the surface area of all 12          can sizes.</div>      </li>      <li>        <div>Your program must compute and print the storage          efficiency of all 12 can sizes.</div>      </li>    </ol>        <h4 id="stretch">Stretch Challenges</h4>    <p>If your team finishes the core requirements in less than an hour,      complete one or more of these stretch challenges.

Replace code in the <code>main</code> function with a call          to the <code>compute_storage_efficiency</code> function as          appropriate.
